# Scholarly Communications Multilingual Lexicon

A collection of scholarly communications and open knowledge terms with translations.

We have started collecting terminology within the field of scholarly communication in order 
to undertake web searches for documents across languages. This lexicon is a work in progress 
to gather terminology in multiple languages. Terminology usage varies by country as well as 
by language, and direct translations do not always capture correct usage. We share this work 
in progress and welcome feedback and suggestions.
